# Whiteboard Magnets
This is a super quick, super fun project I'm working on to learn websockets and Go!

## Tech
I am using React with Typescript for a simple frontend that uses websockets to connect with a simple backend. Multiple clients can log in and see items being dragged and dropped by other users.

## Future
This project is not working right now... it was working and then I decided to push it to Git while in the middle of adding rooms. Bear with me, it will be done.
